# myapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.













The current Dart SDK version is 3.1.0.

Because myapp requires SDK version >=3.4.3 <4.0.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try using the Flutter SDK version: 3.24.2.
